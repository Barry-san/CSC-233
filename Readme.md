# CSC 233 Repository

- This repository contains source code for some past questions for css 233. I'll try to update it as swiftly as possible, and i hope it helps students better familiarise themselves with java syntax and to prepare for examinations.

- Only source files are included in the repo. All code must be compiled before being run on your local machine.
